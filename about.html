      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
     Hey! We're Tayvin and Mateo, two students trying to find a way to output our creativity and craving to spend money on clothe sampling.
      We share a vision: to create versatile, expressive but minimalistic clothing rooted in streetwear.
      Working your 12 hour shift, the gym, or going to the local gas station at 2 AM?
      Our clothes are suited for any situation where comfortability but presentability is needed.
      </p>
      <h4>FAQs</h4>
      <p>Why are you guys so handsome?
        - Some people are just born like that?  Even though thats not the main focus of our brand; looks shouldnt confine who you are!
      </p>
      <p>What inspires you?
        - We're definitely nerds, because our clothing is inspired from anime and manga.  Although, we like putting in our own twists 
        from whatever we find cool or our own cultural backgrounds.
